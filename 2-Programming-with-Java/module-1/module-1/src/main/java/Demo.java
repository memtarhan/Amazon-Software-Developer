/*
Comparable interface

Javaâ€™s standard library has several built-in interfaces, including Serialzable, Clonable, and Comparable interfaces.

The Comparable interface defines how objects are compared. It is generally implemented to sort an array of objects.
It has a compareTo() method, which needs to be implemented by a concrete class.

The following interactive code uses the Comparable interface to compare two objects of the Length class.
The length class has two attributes: cm and mm. The compareTo() method converts the cm value to mm for two objects and
returns 1 or 0, depending on whose mm value is greater or less.
 */

class Length implements Comparable<Length> {
    int cm, mm;

    Length(int cm, int mm) {
        this.cm = cm;
        this.mm = mm;
    }

    @Override
    public int compareTo(Length o) {
        int mmObj1 = this.cm * 10 + this.mm;
        int mmObj2 = o.cm * 10 + o.mm;

        if (mmObj1 > mmObj2)
            return 1;
        else
            return 0;
    }
}
